The goal of this project is to visualize common computer science ideas, structures and theories in Webgl using three.js. Our development browser will be chrome, as it is the furthest along in implementing Webgl. Webgl provides the Opengl library in JavaScript. Opengl is used to render hardware accelerated 2d and 3d graphics; Webgl provides this in a web browser. Three.js is a high-level wrapper library to encapsulate the Webgl library; as well as implementing helper libraries for easier coding.
